// Save configuration
localStorage.setItem('videoInterviewLabelConfig', JSON.stringify(config));

// Load configuration
const config = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('videoInterviewLabelConfig'));
```

### Export/Import
Configurations can be exported and imported as JSON files:

```javascript
// Export
const config = {
  templates: labelTemplates,
  weights: labelWeights,
  customTemplates: customConfigs,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
};

// Import
const importedConfig = JSON.parse(fileContent);
setTemplates(importedConfig.templates);
setWeights(importedConfig.weights);
```

## Best Practices

### Label Selection
1. **Choose Relevant Labels**: Select labels that align with the job requirements
2. **Balance Categories**: Include a mix of technical, behavioral, and general labels
3. **Consider Interview Type**: Use appropriate templates for different interview types
4. **Limit Label Count**: Use 8-12 labels per evaluation for optimal results

### Weight Configuration
1. **Prioritize Key Skills**: Give higher weights to critical job requirements
2. **Balance Weights**: Avoid extreme weight differences (0.5 - 2.5 range recommended)
3. **Review Regularly**: Update weights based on hiring outcomes
4. **Document Decisions**: Keep records of weight justification

### Analytics Usage
1. **Monitor Performance**: Track label performance across candidates
2. **Identify Trends**: Look for patterns in high-performing candidates
3. **Refine Templates**: Update templates based on analytics insights
4. **Share Insights**: Communicate findings with hiring teams

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Label Not Recognized**
   - Check spelling and case sensitivity
   - Ensure label is in the available labels list
   - Verify label format in templates

2. **Weight Not Applied**
   - Confirm weight is set for the specific label
   - Check interview type configuration
   - Verify weight range (0.1 - 3.0)

3. **Analytics Not Showing**
   - Ensure candidate data includes detailed evaluation
   - Check for sufficient data points
   - Verify label categories are properly set

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cache Configurations**: Store frequently used templates locally
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple evaluations together
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load analytics data on demand
4. **Data Cleanup**: Regularly clean old evaluation data
